# Part 1 of advanced ml course project

In this part we implemented  the word2vec and GloVe embedding methods and built the LSTM model. 
In order to activate the model with the specific embedding method - the model recieves the name of the embedding method as a string.
The Goal of this model is to classify movie reviews to positive and negative reviews. In order to train the model we used data from IMDB movie reviews dataset.
At the end of the notebook you can find discussion regarding the model assesment and the different embedding methods.
